"""Loopback-only network policy used by the pytest suite.

Guarded seams (installed at ``pytest_configure`` time so module-level code
imported during collection is covered too): ``socket.socket.connect``,
``socket.socket.connect_ex``, ``socket.socket.sendto``,
``socket.socket.sendmsg`` (where available), ``socket.create_connection``,
and name resolution via ``socket.getaddrinfo`` / ``socket.gethostbyname`` /
``socket.gethostbyname_ex``.

Known limits — this is a tripwire, not a jail:
- Windows asyncio's ProactorEventLoop connects through IOCP ``ConnectEx``
  without calling ``socket.socket.connect``, so asyncio-initiated egress is
  not intercepted there.
- Child processes (MCP stdio servers, pytester subprocesses) inherit no
  patches and are unguarded.
- Reverse DNS (``getnameinfo``/``gethostbyaddr``) and raw sockets are not
  wrapped.
