"""Cross-cutting invariant oracles for trajectory tests.

The operation oracle is applied to complete recording scopes, not every
``FakeSink``: payload-unit tests deliberately emit only one side of a pair.
The accounted-prefix oracle always reads physical ``slots`` so an unreadable
line cannot disappear merely because it is absent from decoded ``events``.
