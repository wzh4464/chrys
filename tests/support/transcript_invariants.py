"""Structural invariants of a kernel tool-loop transcript.

``assert_transcript_invariants`` is the guard oracle for the kernel loop's
final responses. It states, as one mechanical check, what the loop's landing
normalization (``_land_response_contents``), dispatch filter, and result
folding jointly guarantee about the transcript they build — independent of
HOW any particular test drove the loop. ``InvariantCheckedToolLoopLayer``
(below) is how tests apply it: a drop-in ``ToolLoopLayer`` that checks every
final response, blocking and streaming. A hygiene rule in
``tests/architecture/test_test_hygiene.py`` bans bare ``ToolLoopLayer``
construction in tests outside a small allowlist, so oracle coverage is
enforced mechanically rather than by convention. A fuzzing harness in
``tests/kernel/test_loop.py`` additionally drives adversarial (echoing,
id-reusing, object-duplicating) clients against it, and
``tests/kernel/test_transcript_invariants.py`` pins the failure paths of the
oracle itself so no sub-check can silently rot into a no-op.

Why this exists: the echo-normalization work showed that counterexample-shaped
tests only pin the failure shapes someone has already imagined (a dangling
duplicate call, a twice-recorded result, a call wiped out of a shared message
by in-place mutation, a stale ordinal collision). Each of those historical
defects violates one of the invariants below, so a single checker applied
broadly catches the *next* unimagined shape too. When extending loop logic,
run the whole loop suite — if this checker fires, the transcript contract is
broken even if every targeted assertion still passes.

The invariants deliberately do NOT include "every call is answered": the loop
legitimately returns unanswered calls (a no-tools batch, the max-function-call
cap, duplicate-id calls dropped by dispatch, the tool_choice="none" tail), so
that property belongs to individual tests that know their scenario.

    """Assert the structural contract of a kernel-loop final transcript.

    I1 — ordinal integrity: the stamped ``_chrys_tool_invocation_order``
    values over actionable function calls, read in transcript order, form
    one consecutive strictly-increasing run (``k, k+1, …``). The kernel loop
    is the sole producer and stamps at response landing in emission order, so
    a gap, duplicate, or inversion means a stale foreign stamp survived, an
    echo was re-numbered, or two numbering schemes diverged again — the
    exact defect class that mis-attached result metadata across tools. The
    run may start above zero: the middleware-termination exit returns the
    current response WITHOUT the accumulated-transcript prepend, so its
    window legitimately begins mid-run.

    I2 — object identity uniqueness: no non-usage Content and no Message
    object appears twice. Landing removes echoed conversation objects (a
    client re-sending contents or whole messages the run already landed);
    usage is request-scoped accounting and may legitimately reuse one object
    across calls. Any other identity duplicate in the final transcript means
    an echo escaped normalization — the shape that produced dangling
    duplicate calls and double-recorded results.

    I3 — exchange-scoped result pairing: within each exchange (a run of
    assistant messages plus the tool output that follows), every id-bearing
    result — of ANY result content type, hosted MCP included — answers a call
    of that exchange, and no id is answered twice. The pairing id is
    type-aware (``_pairing_key``): image generation pairs on ``image_id``
    (its ``call_id`` is always None), everything else on ``call_id``, and the
    two namespaces never collide. Tool output rides
    tool-role messages OR result-only assistant messages — hosted MCP results
    arrive assistant-role (see ``_is_tool_output_continuation``) — and both
    placements are held to the same pairing rule; results embedded in a
    call-carrying assistant message pair against that (new) exchange, whose
    calls register first, so hosted same-message pairs pass while embedded
    orphans fire. An orphaned result means a call was lost (e.g. a shared
    message mutated in place); a doubly-answered id means an echoed result
    survived. Pairing is scoped to the exchange because providers
    legitimately reuse call ids across iterations — a global check would
    reject valid ``call_00``-style transcripts. Results without their pairing
    id are exempt: they are unpairable by construction (the kernel copies the
    call's empty id onto its result) and are covered by I2 instead.
