    The guarded operations are deterministic: they are metered by visit and
    size budgets, never by a clock, so every sample measures the same work and
    any disturbance is strictly additive. Current-thread CPU time already
    excludes xdist descheduling and unrelated background threads, but it still
    bills the measuring thread for transient kernel work it did not ask for --
    a page-fault or memory-compression storm under parallel-worker memory
    pressure lands inside one window and inflates that one sample. Taking the
    fastest of a few samples rejects that noise by construction, while the
    runaway regressions these guards exist to catch (unmemoized re-expansion,
    exponential path walks) inflate *every* sample and still trip the bound.
