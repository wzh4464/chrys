"""Platform fakes for tests that must not lie about the running OS.

Named ``platform_fakes`` — never ``platform`` — because the ACP client tests
spawn a stub agent as ``sys.executable <tests/support/...>``, which puts this
directory at the front of the child's ``sys.path``; a ``platform.py`` here would
shadow the stdlib ``platform`` module in that subprocess and crash the SDK.

    Windows runner and defeats genuine production platform guards (the
