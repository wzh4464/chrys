"""Engine-side trajectory recorder: session, turn, branch and fork anchors.

The engine owns one :class:`TrajectoryRecorder` for its lifetime; the
recorder owns one :class:`SessionTrajectory` per current session and the
turn it is currently tracing. Every lifecycle anchor calls in here —
``start()`` binds the session, ``shutdown()`` closes it before the empty
directory cleanup, the runner opens turns, the finalizer closes them,
rollback opens a new branch, fork writes the child's prelude. Everything
is best-effort: a disabled, degraded or missing recorder never changes what
the engine does.
