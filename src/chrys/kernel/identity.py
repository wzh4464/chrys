"""Weak-identity primitives for transcript object bookkeeping.

A persisted bare ``id()`` integer neither keeps its object alive nor
notices its death: once the object is collected, the recycled address can
impersonate it. ``WeakIdentityRegistry`` fixes exactly that — membership
requires the registered object itself to still be alive (``ref() is obj``),
so a copy is never a member, a dead member never matches, and address
reuse is harmless by construction.

``ContentList`` exists because several load-bearing identities are LIST
identities (``id(msg.contents)`` captured by compaction anchors and the
summary cache) and built-in ``list`` does not support weak references.
``Message.contents`` coerces every assigned sequence to ``ContentList``,
so captors can hold ``weakref.ref(the_list)`` with today's snapshot
semantics: a replaced contents list stops matching, a shared-list twin
keeps matching, and the reference dies only when the list object truly
dies.
