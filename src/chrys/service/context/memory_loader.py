"""Memory loader — reads ``MemoryConfig`` files/folders into a renderable system-prompt block.

Resolves relative user-configured paths against the workspace cwd, accepts
absolute paths for files and folders, filters to ``.md`` and ``.txt`` files,
scans folders breadth-first with hard bounds (``FOLDER_MAX_DEPTH``
subdirectory levels, ``FOLDER_MAX_FILES`` files per folder, symlink cycle
detection), decodes via
:func:`chrys.foundation.text.encoding.decode_bytes`, and renders the combined content
into a markdown block ready for injection by
:class:`chrys.service.context.providers.memory.MemoryProvider`.  Each
physical file loads at most once — explicit file entries win over
folder-discovered duplicates.

Loading is capped at a token budget (default 35,000).  If the cap is hit,
the remaining files are reported as ``skipped_files`` and ``truncated`` is
set so callers (``agent_builder``) can surface a ``Warning`` event.

    volume roots too.  Redirector-prefixed UNC forms
    ("\\\\;LanmanRedirector\\server\\share", chained "\\\\;a;b\\...") strip
    the ";" specifier before the share-root rule.  Note :func:`_normalize_for_compare` collapses the
    "\\\\.\\" device prefix outright ("\\\\.\\C:\\docs" → "//c:/docs"), so the
    plain-"//" branch must also recognize device heads rather than treat
    them as UNC hostnames.  The final UNC test is deliberately
    conservative: a POSIX "//tmp"-style doubled-slash path is also flagged
    even though it aliases "/tmp" — configure it without the doubled slash
    instead.

    The scan is deliberately bounded so a huge tree (or an accidentally
    configured volume/share) cannot stall agent construction: the folder's
    own files are collected first, then subdirectories up to
    ``FOLDER_MAX_DEPTH`` levels deep, stopping once ``FOLDER_MAX_FILES``
    files are found — breadth-first, so shallow (typically curated) files
    win over deep ones when the cap bites.

    Only files whose physical identity (see ``_file_identity``) is not
    already in *seen_files* are collected — and only those count toward
    ``FOLDER_MAX_FILES``, so aliases of an already-loaded file (explicit,
    earlier-folder, or within this folder) cannot crowd unique files out
    of the cap.  Collected identities are registered in *seen_files* as
    the scan goes.

    The traversal itself is work-bounded: at most
    ``FOLDER_SCAN_MAX_ENTRIES`` directory entries are examined in total
    (a directory wider than the remaining budget is truncated in
    filesystem order), so the file/depth caps cannot be defeated by huge
    or file-less trees.  Since every queued subdirectory was itself an
    entry of its parent, the budget also bounds the number of ``scandir``
    calls.

    Follows symlinks but tracks visited directory ``realpath``s to break
    cycles **and** prunes any directory or single-file symlink whose
    realpath escapes *base* (the workspace for workspace-contained folders,
    the folder itself for absolute folders outside it), so a configured
    folder cannot be tricked into surfacing files from elsewhere.  Returned
    paths keep the scan order — the folder's own files first, then
    subdirectory files level by level, name-sorted within each directory.
    Order is load-bearing: the token cap downstream consumes candidates in
    list order, so shallow files must come first to win when the budget
    bites.
