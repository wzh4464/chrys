"""Cross-session mutation coordination registry.

Resolves the chrys-vs-chrys attribution case: N chrys sessions working in
the same working tree, each publishing what it *provably* wrote, each
subtracting peers' proven writes from its own window inferences.

Storage layout::

    {session_root}/attribution/{repo_key}/{session_id}.json

- ``repo_key`` = first 16 hex chars of sha256 over the canonicalized
  working-tree root (``.git`` directory *or* file — linked worktrees and
  submodules resolve to their own tree).  Outside any repo, a path keys
  by its own directory — a pure function of the path, so independent
  sessions land in the same tree.  Keying by tree root is for
  *discovery* only; matching itself is path-exact.
- One file per (tree, session), **single writer** (the owning session),
  replaced atomically.  Readers tolerate missing/partial/undecodable
  files by skipping them — no cross-process locks.  Within the session
  the registry is in-memory state behind one lock and the file is its
  serialization (no read-modify-write of the file itself).
- Files outlive their session: clean shutdown stamps ``closed_at`` but
  does not delete (late rollbacks in other sessions still need the
  claims).  Removal happens only via opportunistic GC — on write,
  peer files whose mtime is older than :data:`REGISTRY_GC_AGE_SECONDS`
  are deleted.

Reclassification (read side) is **retroactive, idempotent, and runs at
every opportunity** — own finalize, pre-summary display refresh, and
rollback-plan construction.  Matching uses write *intervals* (never
point timestamps) on *canonical* path keys (``realpath`` +
``normcase``).  Conflict rules per overlapping path:

    ========== ============================== ===========================
    local row  evidence                       result
    ========== ============================== ===========================
    ASSUMED    content identity               demote to FOREIGN
    ASSUMED    overlap without identity       stays ASSUMED, contested
    PROVEN     any overlap                    stays PROVEN, contested
    ========== ============================== ===========================

Content identity = hashes present and equal, or both sides gone.
Skip-marked sides and MOVEs never demote (they fall to ``contested``).
Coordination must never break tool execution: every filesystem failure
is swallowed and logged at debug level.
