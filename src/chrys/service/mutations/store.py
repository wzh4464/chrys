"""SnapshotStore — content-addressable blob persistence for file snapshots.

Stores original file content blobs under the session directory, keyed
by SHA-256 hash.  Identical files (across different turns or paths)
share storage automatically.

Blob writes are gated by a :class:`SnapshotPolicy` — oversized or
binary (non-text) file contents are not backed up.  The mutation
metadata is still recorded upstream; only the content blob is withheld
(marked via :class:`SnapshotSkipReason`).

        CONTRACT (agreed design, keep this intact unless you're renegotiating it):

        The rollback modal already shows the user exactly what each
        checked path will look like after the revert (diff-view "after"
        side = snapshot target state).  The user confirms by pressing
        the discard button.  From that point on, revert is unconditional:
        bring each selected file to the target state regardless of what
        sits on disk now.  We deliberately do NOT drift-check or prompt
        — if the user modified the file manually after the agent's turn,
        they either accept the overwrite (file stays checked) or they
        de-select it in the change-list tree.  Simpler logic, guaranteed
        outcome.  A pre-press drift *warning* in the modal (badge only,
        doesn't block) is planned as a follow-up; it belongs in the UI,
        not here.

        Behaviour by snapshot shape:

        - ``existed=False``: the file was created during the rolled-back
          turn → target state is "absent".  Unlink if present; no-op if
          already absent.  Refuses to ``rmtree`` a directory that now
          sits at the path (returns :data:`RestoreOutcome.FAILED`) — the
          blast radius of that operation is far beyond the single path
          the user consented to.
        - ``existed=True``: the file existed at turn start → target
          state is the stored blob content.  Overwrites whatever is at
          the path; creates missing parent directories.  If the path is
          currently a symlink we unlink it first so the replacement is
          a real file (``write_bytes`` would otherwise follow the link
          and corrupt its target).  A directory at the path is likewise
          treated as FAILED.
        - ``is_symlink=True``: the entry was a symlink at turn start →
          target state is a link pointing at the stored target text.
          The replacement link is built at a temporary sibling path and
          swapped over whatever sits at the path (file or link) with
          ``os.replace``, so a failed creation (Windows without
          privilege, filesystems without symlink support) reports
          FAILED with the existing entry preserved — never degraded to
          a regular file, never destroyed.  The temporary name is
          unique per call; an existing entry at a candidate name is
          never unlinked.  A directory at the path is FAILED.
          ``symlink_target_is_dir`` is forwarded as
          ``target_is_directory`` so Windows directory links recreate
          with the right kind (POSIX ignores it); on platforms whose
          links are typed, NOOP additionally requires the on-disk
          link's kind to match the recorded one — POSIX links are
          untyped, so the text match alone is NOOP there.  An
          unprovable recorded kind (``None``) is inferred from what
          the target text resolves to at restore time.

        Returns a :class:`RestoreResult` — APPLIED when we mutated disk,
        NOOP when it was already in target state, FAILED otherwise with
        ``reason`` populated.
