"""fsatrace write tracing for the shell child tree (provenance Layer 3).

Wraps shell subprocess launches in `fsatrace <https://github.com/jacereda/
fsatrace>`_ so the actual write set of the child process tree is observed
(``LD_PRELOAD`` on Linux, DLL injection on Windows, DYLD insertion on
macOS — where SIP/hardened runtime usually block it; the probe below
auto-skips).

The evidence is strictly one-directional:

- a path in the trace write-set was written by our child tree →
  the matching window-detected mutation upgrades to ``PROVEN``;
- a path *absent* from the trace proves nothing (SIP-stripped injection,
  statically linked binaries, ``env -i`` children) → the row stays
  ``ASSUMED``.

The trace never *adds* mutations: out-of-scope writes (gitignored build
output etc.) are excluded from tracking by policy, and matching is done
by intersecting trace lines against the already-detected row set — the
full write set of a build command is never materialized.

Availability is probed once per process: ``CHRYS_MUTATION_TRACE=off``
disables outright; otherwise ``CHRYS_FSATRACE_PATH`` (authoritative when
set — no fallback past a broken override) or ``shutil.which`` locates the
binary, and a one-shot self-test (trace a trivial write, expect it in the
log) validates it.  Any launch- or parse-time failure degrades to
unwrapped execution / no upgrades — shell behavior must be identical with
tracing on, off, or broken.
