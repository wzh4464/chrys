"""Hook system — user-defined scripts/commands fired around agent lifecycle.

Hooks let users run external commands at well-defined points: session
start/end, turn boundaries, user prompts, and tool calls.  Each hook
is a ``script`` / ``command`` / ``shell`` invocation matched by event,
profile, and tool metadata.

Config lives at ``<config_dir>/hooks/hooks.yaml`` (or ``.yml`` / ``.json``
with the same schema).  See :mod:`chrys.service.hooks.schema` for the on-disk shape and
:mod:`chrys.service.hooks.manager` for the runtime orchestrator.
