"""Hook event names — string enum for every lifecycle point.

The string values are part of the user-facing YAML schema, so renaming
one is a breaking change.  All event payloads share a ``schema`` /
``event`` / ``session_id`` / ``cwd`` / ``profile`` envelope; event-
specific fields are listed in each member's docstring.
