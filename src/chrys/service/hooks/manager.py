"""Hook orchestrator — single entry point for every wire-up site.

The manager owns:

* The parsed :class:`HooksFile` (matched + filtered per dispatch).
* The :class:`HookRunner` (subprocess execution).
* The :class:`Outbox` (durable jobs).
* A set of in-flight non-detached tasks split into "this turn" /
  "this session" / "background" so drains can target only awaited work.

Callers fire events through :meth:`fire`; the return value is a
:class:`HookDecision` that aggregates the event-supported outputs from
blocking hooks.  Pure observer events can ignore the return value.
