        quarantined: a canonical path occupied by another file that is itself
        about to move (``A.yaml`` defining ``B`` while ``B.yaml`` defines
        ``A``) is a pending target, not a conflict, so both files end up

        not (permissions, no free quarantine name) keeps blocking its path;
