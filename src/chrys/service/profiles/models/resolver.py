"""Model profile resolution — pick the active profile for a given role.

Resolution lives here (rather than in ``ModelProfileRegistry``) so the
registry stays a pure data store.  Callers (``AgentEngine``, sub-agent
construction, the approval judge, the buddy notifier) ask the resolver
for the right ``ModelProfile`` to use; resolution policy can grow new
roles or override layers without touching the registry.
