"""Trajectory prelude of a forked session.

A fork copies the conversation but never the parent's ``trajectory/`` (the
parent's writer may be live, and the fork's events must start at sequence 1
with their own runtime). Instead the fork opens its own log with a complete
mini runtime — ``session.started`` then ``session.forked`` pointing back at
the origin and the parent sequence the fork branched from — and closes it
again, so a later restore of the fork resumes a cleanly closed runtime.
