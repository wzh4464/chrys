"""Emit one base event whose unbounded fields continue in ``event.segment`` lines.

The base event is written first carrying ``segmented_fields[]`` (group id and
count per field), then every segment of every field in index order. The
segment lines are measured against the same envelope the writer produces, so
each one fits the line budget exactly as the writer will see it.
