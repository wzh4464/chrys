"""Backstop stamping of analytics item ids on persisted history.

Items normally get their ``_chrys_analytics_item_id`` when they are created
(the executor stamps user messages, the kernel loop stamps what it lands).
Anything that reached history another way — recovery re-creation, a
restored legacy session, a marker the history manager inserted — is
stamped here right before the save that persists it, so every saved item
has an id before any trajectory event could refer to it.
