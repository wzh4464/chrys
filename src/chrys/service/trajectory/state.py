"""Turn identity persisted alongside the conversation (``chrys_trajectory`` state key).

``turn_id`` is minted per turn start and never reused; ``turn_number`` is the
display ordinal (``_turn``) a rollback may hand out again. Rollback and a
later runtime need the mapping between the two — ``session.rollback`` names
its ``target_turn_id`` and the first superseded sequence — so the recorder
keeps a tiny registry inside the session state: it rides along with every
save, snapshot, restore and fork exactly like the messages it describes, and
a rollback snapshot therefore restores the registry as of that turn.
