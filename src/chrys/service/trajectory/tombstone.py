"""Logical session deletion while a trajectory writer may still hold the file.

``/clear`` and delete remove the whole session directory. If the session's
trajectory writer is still alive — a worker stuck in ``write()`` in this
process, or a live writer in another process — the directory cannot simply be
removed: on Windows the open descriptor blocks the unlink, and on POSIX the
stuck worker would keep writing into an unlinked inode while the caller
believes the data is gone. So deletion becomes *logical* first:

1. rename the session directory into ``<sessions>/.tombstones/`` (dot-prefixed
   entries are never listed as sessions) and ``fsync`` the parent, so the
   intent is durable before the index / MRU entries are removed;
2. if the rename itself fails (Windows refuses to rename a directory with an
   open child), write a durable *intent* file naming the directory instead and
   remove whatever can be removed now;
3. the physical cleanup happens in :func:`sweep_tombstones` — at the next
   startup, or whenever a caller asks — and only for tombstones whose writer
   lease this process can take *and hold* for the removal, so a writer in
   another process is never pulled from under its feet, nor allowed to start
   while the directory is going away.

Callers never block on the stuck worker.
