"""One live session's trajectory recorder.

:class:`SessionTrajectory` is the engine-owned :class:`TrajectorySink`. It is
created cheaply whenever a session becomes current and activates itself on
the first event: ensure the owner-only ``<session>/trajectory/`` directory,
take the per-session writer lease, recover a torn tail under the session
write lock, then start the single writer and record the coverage prelude
(``coverage.started`` / ``runtime.started`` / ``runtime.recovered`` /
``session.started``). Activation failures never fail the session — the
recorder simply stays disabled and every ``emit`` answers ``DEGRADED``.

Lazy activation keeps the session directory unmaterialized for sessions that
never produce an event, which is what the empty-session cleanup relies on;
the engine closes the recorder *before* that cleanup runs, so a writer never
outlives its directory.
