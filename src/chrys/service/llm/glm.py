"""GLM (Zhipu AI / z.ai) chat-completion client.

GLM's API is OpenAI-compatible at the wire level and speaks the same
``reasoning_content`` dialect as DeepSeek, so the base
``RawOpenAIChatCompletionClient`` already captures and replays its
reasoning; this subclass only encodes GLM endpoint policy:

- ``TOKEN_LIMIT_PARAM``: GLM's Chat Completions API documents only the
  OpenAI-legacy ``max_tokens`` output cap, not ``max_completion_tokens``.
- Reasoning replay keeps the base's unconditional policy: z.ai's
  thinking-mode contract (preserved thinking) requires historical
  ``reasoning_content`` to be replayed on every multi-turn request,
  including turns without tool calls — see
  https://docs.z.ai/guides/llm/glm-4.7 (interleaved/preserved thinking)
  and https://docs.bigmodel.cn/api-reference (Chat Completions schema).
