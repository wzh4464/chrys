"""O(visible) drag selection for the chat transcript.

Textual's generic cross-widget selection walker
(:meth:`SelectState._walk_selected_widgets`) re-walks and re-sorts every
transcript widget on every mouse move, and ``Screen._watch_selections``
notifies every previously/currently selected widget even when its selection
did not change. On sessions with thousands of transcript widgets a simple
drag pegs a CPU core.

This module replaces the geometric walk with a *logical* selection model for
drags whose both endpoints live in the same :class:`ChatPanel`:

- Every top-level transcript widget gets a monotonically increasing mount
  sequence (stamped by ``ChatPanel.mount``). A leaf's *document key* is the
  tuple ``(top_seq, *sibling_indices)`` down to the leaf, so document order
  comparisons never touch the compositor.
- Selection anchors are (leaf, content offset) pairs. Membership of any leaf
  in the selected range is a pure key comparison, so per-mouse-move work is
  bounded by the widgets in the compositor's visible map — never the whole
  transcript — even while the drag auto-scrolls or the anchors sit offscreen.
- ``screen.selections`` only ever contains the visible slice plus the two
  anchor leaves. Copy walks the anchored range once, at copy time.
- After the drag ends the anchors are content-addressed, so scrolling only
  needs a cheap re-projection (hooked from ``ChatPanel.watch_scroll_y``) to
  keep highlights correct as selected content scrolls in and out of view.
