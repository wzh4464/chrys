"""In-memory search index for project path suggestions.

The index is built during file-suggestion warmup, not during synchronous input
handling.  Construction pre-normalizes each candidate once and query returns a
bounded top-k result with the same ordering semantics as ``fuzzy_filter``:
match position, original path length, then original path text.
