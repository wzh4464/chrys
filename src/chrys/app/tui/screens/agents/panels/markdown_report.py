    Collapsing all whitespace runs (newlines included) means crafted remote

    markdown pipeline passes raw text through to the terminal, so embedded
    CSI/OSC escape sequences would otherwise reach it verbatim (screen
    clears, OSC-52 clipboard writes). Inline markup is left alone: it can
    only restyle the string's own text, which plain content could fake
    anyway.

    One caveat remains for callers: the result is only block-inert when it
    is NOT placed at the start of a rendered line — leading ``#``/``-``/
    ``>`` are still block syntax there. Start report lines with your own
    marker (bullet, bold, quote + italic) before any remote text.
