"""Value coercion for settings, shared by every configuration layer.

One coercer per field, owned by the field's ``SettingSpec`` — so parsing,
clamping and fallback live in exactly one place instead of being re-derived by
each reader (dataclass default, ACP validator, headless warning path, …).

Coercers take a **raw** value from any layer and normalise it to one canonical
value. YAML hands over already-typed values (``true``, ``50``); dotenv and the
process environment hand over strings. Both must land on the same result, so
the grammar below is defined once and every coercer accepts the native type
and the string spelling of it.

A coercer never raises and never invents a fallback: it reports what the raw
value *is*.

* ``MISSING`` — this layer says nothing about the field; the loader moves to
  the next layer down. Absent keys, blank strings and YAML ``null`` all land
  here.
* ``VALID`` / ``CLAMPED`` — a usable canonical value, the latter adjusted to a
  declared bound.
* ``INVALID`` — unusable. The layer contributes nothing, exactly as if it were
  ``MISSING``, but a record is produced. What to do with that record is the
  loader's call: user-visible for a project file (which must be able to say
  "this key of this file was rejected"), a log line for the historical env
  behaviour.

Encoding "invalid" as *the field default* — the shape this module had first —
makes the project layer undecidable: the loader cannot tell a repository that
legitimately set the default value from one whose garbage was silently
swallowed, and would label the default as coming from the project.
