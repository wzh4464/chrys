"""Notification event identity, shared by settings and the TUI delivery layer.

Pure data on purpose: the persisted ``notifications.events.*`` settings keys
and the app-layer delivery service must agree on one set of event names, and
foundation cannot import the app layer, so the enum lives here. Labels,
descriptions, and delivery behaviour stay in ``chrys.app.tui.notifications``.
