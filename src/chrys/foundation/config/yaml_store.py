"""Locked read-modify-write primitives for chrys' YAML config documents.

Every persisted YAML config under ``~/.chrys/`` goes through
:func:`update_yaml_doc`. There is deliberately **no** bare ``write_yaml_doc``:
a lock-free read followed by a locked whole-file write is only safe when a
single object owns the whole document. Once several panels (or processes)
patch different keys of the same file, the last writer would silently clobber
keys it never read.

Layering the other way round — take the lock in the caller, then call a
function that takes it again — self-deadlocks: ``FileLock`` first grabs a
**non-reentrant** ``threading.Lock`` keyed by lock path
(:func:`chrys.foundation.util.lock._get_path_lock`). Hence one public entry
point that owns the whole critical section, and unlocked helpers stay private.

Reads take the lock too. On Windows an open read handle blocks ``os.replace``,
so an unlocked reader would make a concurrent writer fail rather than merely
observe a stale document.
