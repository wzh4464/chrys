"""Origin registry for the live model-profile pointer.

``CHRYS_MODEL_PROFILE`` in ``os.environ`` is not a configuration source but a
**live process pointer**: activating a profile writes it and the very next
settings reload reads it back. The carrier can say *what* the pointer is but
never *who* wrote it — and the writer cannot be reconstructed from the value
(a restored session may write the same id the shell exported; ``--model`` may
match the frozen snapshot). So every process-level writer records its own
origin here, and the loader reports the pointer under that origin instead of
blaming the environment.

Per-host selections (a session pin, headless ``--model``) never touch this
registry — it is process-global, and in an ACP process one session's choice
must not rewrite another session's provenance. Those stay host-local pins on
their own ``LoadedSettings``.

Value and origin are two variables that mean one thing, and the writers no
longer all run on the same thread — profile activation moved to a worker so
the settings file's lock cannot stall an event loop. So every access takes
:data:`_lock`, and readers take *both* halves inside it: a read that fetches
the value and then the origin can pair one writer's value with another
writer's origin, which is precisely the mistake this registry exists to
prevent. Undoing a write needs more than the lock, hence :attr:`_generation`
— see :func:`restore_model_pointer`.
