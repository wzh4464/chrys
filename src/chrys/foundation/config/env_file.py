    Removal matches the way the OS reads the file, not the way the line is

    ``chrys_theme`` line answers for ``CHRYS_THEME`` and must go when that key
    goes — otherwise the migration leaves behind a spelling that keeps
    overriding the user's document. On POSIX the spellings are distinct keys
    and only the exact one is touched.

            to this. Checked *inside* the lock, which is the only place the
            check means anything — a caller comparing beforehand has merely
            moved its own race. Removals are the reason it exists: they delete
            lines chosen from an earlier read of this file, and between the two
            the file may have grown a key that read never saw.

    Returns whether the file was left in the requested state; ``False`` only
    ever means the fingerprint did not match, and nothing was written.
