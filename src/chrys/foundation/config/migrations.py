"""Component migrations into the user settings document.

Importing an external legacy format is tracked in the ``migrations:`` ledger,
never inferred from the document's existence: a crash between "wrote the YAML"
and "cleaned the old source" must retry the cleanup on the next start, and a
user who pre-created ``settings.yaml`` by hand has not thereby migrated
anything. Each component entry is either a completion timestamp or
``{pending_cleanup: true}``.

Every migration is strictly three-phase, holding at most one configuration
lock at any moment:

- **A** (settings lock): read the old source, coerce, merge and commit with
  ``pending_cleanup: true``.
- **B** (the old source's own lock, never the settings lock): retire the old
  source. Nesting ``.env.lock`` inside the settings lock is a deadlock waiting
  for its second process, so cross-file consistency comes from the resumable
  ledger, not from lock nesting.
- **C** (settings lock again): replace ``pending_cleanup`` with the
  completion timestamp. A crash before C reruns B, which is idempotent.

Which side wins the merge depends on the ledger, and the two answers are not
in tension:

- While the component is **unfinished** — no entry, or ``pending_cleanup`` —
  the document wins. A rerun after a crash between phases must not roll a
  later panel edit back to the old file.
- Once it is **complete**, an old source that is active again became active
  *after* we finished, and the only thing that writes these formats now is a
  downgraded install that cannot see the document. That makes it the newer
  intent: it wins, and the component reopens to retire it again. Importing it
  under the document-wins rule instead would delete the newer value and keep
  the stale one, and skipping it would leave a legacy layer outranking every
  panel write for good — the exact "I changed it and nothing happened" these
  migrations exist to end.

Phase B never retires a source it cannot prove is the one phase A read, and
never on a read that did not succeed. The two are separate guarantees:

- *Same bytes.* The retirement is gated on a fingerprint taken before the
  parse and rechecked under the source's own lock. A source that moved in
  between digests as its older self, so the recheck fails and the component
  stays pending for the next start to fold in and retry.
- *A real read.* Cleanup removes the whole key space, not the keys that were
  found, so "this source holds nothing of ours" and "this source could not be
  read" must not arrive here as the same empty mapping. An unreadable source
  aborts the migration before anything is written or deleted.
