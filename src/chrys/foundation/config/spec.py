"""Per-field settings metadata, declared on the dataclass field itself.

``Settings`` stays a plain dataclass — no registry to keep in sync, no schema
DSL, and ``ty`` still checks every field's type. Everything the loader, the
settings panel and the project-layer policy need rides along in
``field(metadata=spec(...))``:

    theme: str = field(
        default=DEFAULT_THEME,
        metadata=spec(key="ui.theme", env="CHRYS_THEME", apply=Apply.LIVE, ...),
    )

Adding a new setting is then one field declaration, which is the test of
whether this design holds up when the remaining hidden parameters land.
