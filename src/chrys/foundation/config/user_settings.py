"""The user settings document: path, dotted-key flattening, and patching.

``~/.chrys/settings.yaml`` stores dotted setting keys as nested YAML so a
human can edit it. This module owns the two directions of that shape —
nested document to ``{"ui.theme": ...}`` for the loader, and a dotted-key
patch back into the nested document for :func:`persist` — plus the document
housekeeping (``schema_version``, the ``migrations`` ledger) that must never
be mistaken for settings.

    ``ui.theme``) is replaced, because the two cannot both be there. Such a
    node is already reported as an unknown key by every load, so this replaces
    something the reader was told was not in effect.

    A patched or removed key also sheds its rival spellings: the flattener
    accepts a known key written as a dotted literal at any depth, and a
    surviving ``ui.theme: dark`` line would keep answering for a setting the
