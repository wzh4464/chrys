"""Evaluation context: what the loader needs to know that is not a setting.

Some project-layer checks cannot be decided from the stored value alone. The
transient-retry budget is the case that forces this: a stored ``None`` means
"use the frontend's policy default", which is 7 in the TUI and 15 in headless,
so the *same* project value of 10 is a loosening for one frontend and a
tightening for the other. Comparing raw fields would silently apply the wrong
verdict in headless.

This lives in its own module so both :mod:`chrys.foundation.config.spec` (which
types the comparator) and the loader can import it without a cycle through
``settings``.
