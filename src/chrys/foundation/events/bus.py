class EventBus:
    """In-process async event bus.

    Supports both callback-based subscriptions and async iteration (streaming).
    Designed as the sole communication channel between frontend and backend.

    Two delivery mechanisms with deliberately different backpressure:

    * ``subscribe()`` callbacks are awaited inline by :meth:`publish`, so a slow
      handler backpressures the publisher. Never lossy. Downstream ordering
      contract: the TUI's tool-card routing relies on this — a tool's
      ToolCallStart handler chain completes before the tool executes, so a
      call's result can never overtake its own start (see
      ``app.tui.widgets.chat.tool_registry``). Making publish fire-and-forget
      would silently re-open mid-mount routing races there.
    * ``stream()`` iterators receive events through an **unbounded** per-consumer
      queue (:class:`_EventStream`). :meth:`publish` enqueues without awaiting, so
      it never blocks on a slow consumer, and the queue is unbounded so it never
      drops. A stalled consumer therefore grows memory (bounded in practice by a
      single turn's events — the stream is opened and torn down per turn) rather
      than losing events.
