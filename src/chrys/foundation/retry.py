"""Reusable run-retry loop.

Extracted from :class:`chrys.orchestration.engine.executor.Executor` so the main agent and
sub-agents can share one implementation of:

- per-attempt retry on :class:`StreamStall` and caller-defined transient errors
- exponential backoff with interruptible sleep
- history snapshot/restore between attempts
- ``RetryAttempt``-style event publishing (caller decides the event payload
  so sub-agents can emit ``SubAgentRetryAttempt`` instead)

The loop is intentionally un-opinionated about event types, history shape,
and "what counts as retryable" — everything is injected via callbacks.

class HistorySnapshot(NamedTuple):
    """Immutable snapshot of history state for retry rollback.

    ``messages`` is a shallow list copy taken before the attempt; the
    restore callback installs a fresh shallow copy on every rollback so
    later attempts cannot mutate the reusable snapshot. This also undoes
    mid-attempt compressions. ``compressed_count`` is the pre-attempt length of
    ``compressed_msgs`` — anything appended during the rolled-back
    attempt is truncated back to this length. ``service_session_id`` is
    provider-side continuation state; restoring it prevents a retry from
    continuing an incomplete server-side attempt.

    ``message_properties`` captures each message's ``additional_properties``
    (same order as ``messages``) so rollback can restore them *exactly*: the
    Message objects are shared between the snapshot list and the live wire
    view, so a failed attempt's in-place annotations (``_excluded`` flags from
    automatic compaction, ``_group`` summarized-by markers, token counts)
    survive the list swap and must be reverted value-by-value. An exact
    restore both clears the failed attempt's marks and preserves marks that
    legitimately predate the attempt — a reason-based clearing heuristic can
    do only one or the other.

    ``pre_output_history_len`` is request-time compaction's transient
    current-turn metadata floor.  Retry rollback must restore it with the
    rest of the history state, otherwise a floor written by a failed attempt
    can scope the successful retry's post-run metadata to the wrong slice.

    ``caller_state`` is an opaque snapshot owned by the callback provider.
    The reusable retry loop never inspects it; main-agent callers use it to
    roll back auxiliary per-run recorders atomically with history.
