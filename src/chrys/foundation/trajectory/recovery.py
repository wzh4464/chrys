"""Activation-time recovery for an existing events file.

A crash can leave a torn final line. Appending after it would turn the torn
bytes into a bad line in the *middle* of the file, where "ignore the last
line" no longer applies. So before a writer resumes a file it must, under the
session's exclusive lock: locate the last complete newline, truncate the
torn tail, and recover ``sequence`` from the last valid event.
