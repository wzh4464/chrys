"""Session writer lease: one trajectory writer per session, across processes.

The lease is an OS-level file lock on ``<session>/trajectory/writer.lock``. It
is bound to the *writer worker*, not to the "currently active session": the UI
may switch sessions while a stuck worker still holds the descriptor, and the
lease keeps following that worker until it exits (or the OS reclaims it when
the process dies — at which point the stuck thread is gone too).

Acquisition never blocks: a held lease means "this session already has a
writer somewhere", and the caller opens the session trajectory-disabled.
