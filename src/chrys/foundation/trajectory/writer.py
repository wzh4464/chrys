"""Single-writer, write-through trajectory event log with written-ack.

Contract:

* **Write-through** — ``emit`` returns only after the whole line reached the
  file (or after it is certain the event has no persistence guarantee). There
  is no "returned but still queued" state. Normal events are not ``fsync``ed;
  only checkpoints and the graceful-close tail are, and one of those answers
  DEGRADED when its ``fsync`` fails even though its line was written.
* **Ordered hand-off for synchronous producers** — a call site that cannot
  await (a ``finally`` in a sync function, a callback) uses ``submit`` +
  ``wait`` instead: ``submit`` takes the sequence and hands the encoded line
  to the worker before it returns, so ordering against every later ``emit``
  holds, and only the ack is awaited elsewhere. Such a producer learns
  nothing about persistence — but a later awaited ``WRITTEN`` still proves
  its line is on disk or explained by a gap.
* **Accounted prefix** — the worker writes strictly in ``sequence`` order. A
  ``WRITTEN`` ack for ``N`` proves every smaller sequence either has a line
  or is covered by a ``trajectory.gap`` persisted before ``N``.
* **Bounded wait, terminal degrade** — a producer waits at most
  ``write_ack_timeout``; a timeout or write failure flips the writer into
  ``TERMINAL_DEGRADED`` (one-way). Queued-not-started events become virtual
  slots with their payload released; the in-flight batch may finish and is
  confirmed line by line; later emits only register slots. Only gap/closure
  records may still be written, by the same worker, on the same descriptor.
* **Two-state result** — :class:`EmitResult.WRITTEN` carries the persistence
  guarantee; :class:`EmitResult.DEGRADED` carries none.

The worker is a dedicated daemon thread (never a ``ThreadPoolExecutor``): a
thread stuck in ``write()`` on a network disk must not keep the interpreter
from exiting, and the writer never opens a second descriptor or thread for
the same session.
