"""Context-revision chains: exact request membership as checkpoints and deltas.

Every wire request's context is a *revision* of the actor's previous one.
A revision records which items (by ``analytics_item_id``) the request
carried, in order and with repeats, so the analysis layer can replay the
exact context of any exchange without re-reading ``session.json``. The
first revision of a chain and every ``CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL``-th one is a
full checkpoint; the rest carry only the entries added and removed since
their parent. A keyed ``membership_hash`` over the full ordered membership
rides on every revision so a reconstructed chain can be verified.

Entries are ``{item_id, occurrence, position, action}``: ``occurrence`` is
the 0-based repeat index of that item within the request (so an item sent
twice is two distinct entries) and ``position`` its 0-based index in the
request; both are required for exact membership.
