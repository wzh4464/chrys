"""Usage buckets for ``model.exchange.finished``.

``provider_reported`` keeps the usage mapping as the wire adapter handed it
over — provider-specific extras and their nested breakdowns included, under a
soft budget on the shapes adapters produce. ``normalized`` is the explicit
bucket set analytics sums over; every bucket is copied, never guessed, and a
missing bucket stays missing (missing ≠ 0).

``USAGE_ADAPTER_VERSION`` 1 defines:

* ``input_total`` — the provider's input/prompt count as reported. Whether
  it includes cache reads is provider-defined, so it is *not* exclusive of
  ``cache_read`` / ``cache_creation``; consumers that need an uncached input
  figure derive it per provider.
* ``cache_read`` / ``cache_creation`` — provider-managed prompt-cache counts.
* ``output_total`` — every generated token, reasoning included.
* ``reasoning`` — the reasoning subset of ``output_total``.
* ``output_visible`` — ``output_total - reasoning``, present only when both
  operands are; this is the one exclusive bucket the adapter derives.

    soft budget over what adapters produce, and the breakdowns are what give
