"""Read-only access to a trajectory events file with corruption diagnostics.

The reader never writes back. A torn trailing line is reported (and handled
by the writer's recovery path); a bad line in the *middle* of the file is
corruption and yields an in-memory diagnostic gap rather than being skipped
silently. Unknown event types — and events written under a schema this build
does not know — are decoded, counted, and reported so that the region they
fall in is never declared exact by downstream analysis.
