"""Opt-in eager composition for large Textual mount batches.

Textual normally starts one message pump per newly registered widget and lets
each pump compose and register its own children. That lifecycle is ideal for
incremental UI changes, but a persisted transcript already exists as one stable
tree: hundreds of parent pumps otherwise serialize hundreds of small child
registration operations.

``precompose_tree`` materializes an unattached widget forest synchronously, so
Textual's existing recursive ``App._register`` path can register and style the
whole forest in one operation. The runtime wrapper only skips the later Compose
event for widgets explicitly placed in that forest; all other Textual widgets
retain the upstream lifecycle.
