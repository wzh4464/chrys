"""Patches for third-party dependencies.

This module provides a mechanism to apply targeted patches to installed
site-packages when upstream libraries lack required features. Each patch
is defined as a pair of code fragments (original → patched). The patcher
validates the source file before applying:

- If it matches the original → apply the patch
- If it already matches the patched version → skip (idempotent)
- If it matches neither → raise an error (upstream changed, patch needs update)

Call ``apply_all()`` at startup before the patched code is imported.
