"""Out-of-band tool-call provenance context channel.

Mirrors the ``chrys_kind`` attribute channel (:mod:`chrys.foundation.tool_kinds`):
producers attach a small JSON-safe provenance dict to a tool object, and the
persistence pipeline copies it onto the assistant ``function_call`` content as
``additional_properties["_chrys_tool_context"]`` so offline session.json
readers can answer "which skill? which MCP server?" without name guessing.

Two segments with different lifecycles:

- **static** (:func:`set_tool_context`) — fixed at tool creation
  (e.g. MCP server/remote identity); sanitized once at registration and read
  back as-is.
- **builder** (:func:`set_tool_context_builder`) — computed per invocation
  from the final call args (e.g. canonical skill names); sanitized at
  resolve time by the same segment sanitizer.

Sanitization is exact-or-absent per segment: values are identifiers, so a
non-conforming or over-cap value drops its key (never truncated — a mangled
identifier is worse than a missing one), and an over-budget segment drops
whole. Provenance must never break tool creation or execution: nothing in
this module raises on bad producer input; problems are debug-logged.
