"""Cross-platform advisory file lock for serialising shared-file writes.

When multiple chrys processes touch the same file under ``~/.chrys/`` (config,
session metadata, mutation snapshots, etc.), wrapping the read-modify-write in
a :class:`FileLock` against a sibling ``.lock`` file prevents lost updates and
torn writes. The OS releases the lock automatically when the file descriptor
closes (process exit, crash, or normal release), so stale lock files are not a
concern.

POSIX uses ``fcntl.flock`` (LOCK_EX, advisory). Windows uses ``msvcrt.locking``
(LK_LOCK, mandatory on the locked byte range). Both are blocking by default;
release happens on context exit or fd close.
